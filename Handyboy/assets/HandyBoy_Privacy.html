<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.17in"><FONT FACE="Times, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Welcome
to the HandyBoy.com website and HandyBoy application (collectively
the “Platform”) and, if applicable, choosing to use our service
(“Service”) At HandyBoy (“HandyBoy”), we try to make our
Privacy Policy easy to understand so that you are informed as to how
we use your information.   Additionally, since we believe that
laughter is the best medicine (well except for Benadryl – we do
love getting giddy on cough syrup) we've tried&nbsp;to make this
Privacy Policy a little more light-hearted.  Please keep in mind that
this doesn’t mean that our Privacy Policy is any less binding or
serious. This Privacy Policy, like our Terms of Service, is an
integral part of using our Service; therefore you must completely
agree to our Privacy Policy in order to use our Platform or Service. 
You must be over the age of 18 to use our Platform or Service. 
Please keep in mind that you should have read our Terms of Service by
now.  If you have not, please do so now.  We mean right now! If you
do not read and agree to the Terms of Service and the Privacy Policy,
please do not pass Go, do not collect two hundred dollars, and do not
use our Platform and Service.</FONT></FONT></P>

and zodiac sign. We may allow you to login through Facebook and we
may collect any information you make available through Facebook.
Please be aware that we may also collect your credit card information
for payment.  The credit card information collected will be processed
and stored by Braintree, which as horrific as it sounds, is not a
zombie-like plant which consumes human brains, but rather a
convenient payment processor… which may or may not consume human
brains.  </FONT></FONT>

them).   We may also collect financial information including your

voluntary compliance on the part of your ISP, or additional records

you are entering into an Agreement with HandyBoy to disclose your

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.17in"><FONT FACE="Times, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Throughout
the course of our provision of our Services to you, we may delegate
our authority to collect, access, use, and disseminate your
information.  It is therefore necessary that you grant the third
parties we may use in the course of our business the same rights that
you afford us under this Privacy Policy.  For this reason, you hereby
agree that for every authorization which you grant to us in this
Privacy Policy, you also grant to any third party that we may hire,
contract, become blood brothers with, or otherwise retain the
services of for the purpose of operating, maintaining, repairing, or
otherwise improving or preserving our website or its underlying files
or systems.  You agree not to hold us liable for the actions of any
of these third parties, even if we would normally be held vicariously
liable for their actions, and that you must take legal action against
them directly should they commit any tort (not to be confused with
tortillas, which are delicious) or other actionable wrong against
you.  </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.17in"><FONT FACE="Times, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, you authorize us to use

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.17in"><FONT FACE="Times, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>You
agree that we may disclose your information to authorities (in highly
technical legal terms, these are known as the “Five-O”) if
compelled to by a court order.  Additionally, you agree that we may
disclose your information if we reasonably believe that you have
violated US law or the terms of our Terms of Service or Privacy
Policy or if we believe that a third party is at risk of bodily harm.
  In the event that we receive a subpoena affecting your privacy, we
may elect to notify you to give you an opportunity to file a motion
to quash the subpoena, or we may attempt to quash it ourselves, but
we are not obligated to do either.  This is all discretionary and
really depends on the situation.  If Vladimir Putin asks us for your
information so he can crush the evil Western dog who made fun of him
online, we may choose to attempt to quash it or at least notify you. 
On the other hand, if the police ask us for the identity of a person
who’s been scamming people using our website, we will likely turn
that person’s info over immediately and eat popcorn while we watch
them get taken down on the next episode of Cops.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.17in"><FONT FACE="Times, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>We
may also proactively report you and release your information without
receiving any request to third parties where we believe that it is
proper to do so for legal reasons, such as instances where we believe
your publications violate any law of the United States or any other
country having jurisdiction over us, our Platform, Services, or our
Terms of Service.  You release us from any damages that may arise
from or relate to the release of your information to a request from
law enforcement agencies or private litigants.  We may release your
information under the conditions listed in this paragraph whether it
is to individuals or entities and to any state or national
authorities, as required.</FONT></FONT></P>
