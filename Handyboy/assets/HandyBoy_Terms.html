Arbitration under this Agreement shall be conducted pursuant to the
Commercial or Consumer Arbitration Rules then prevailing at the
American Arbitration Association. The arbitrator's award shall be
final and binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of
competent jurisdiction.  Each party shall be responsible for their
own arbitration fees and costs. To the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, no arbitration under this Agreement shall be joined
to an arbitration involving any other party subject to this
Agreement, whether through class action proceedings or otherwise. You
agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any
claim or cause of action arising out of, related to or connected with
the use of the Platform or this Agreement must be filed within one
(1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever
banned. In the event that the law does not permit the abovementioned
dispute to be resolved through arbitration, you agree that any
actions shall be brought solely in a court of competent jurisdiction
located within or nearest to Los Angeles County, CA. The prevailing
party in any such action shall be entitled to their reasonable
attorneys’ fees and costs.  </FONT></FONT>
